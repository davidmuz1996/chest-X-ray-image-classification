# chest-X-ray-image-classification

### Dataset description

The Chest X-Ray Dataset consolidates thousands of publicly available radiographic images into a unified three-class classification task: Normal, Pneumonia, and Tuberculosis.<br>
The dataset is organized into class-labeled folders and pre divided into training (80%), validation (10%), and testing (10%) subsets.<br>
This structure supports consistent model evaluation and facilitates experiments with both classical machine learning and deep learning approaches.

### Goal

The goal of this project is to build a model capable of classifying chest X-ray images as Normal, Pneumonia, or Tuberculosis, thereby supporting automated detection of lung diseases.
